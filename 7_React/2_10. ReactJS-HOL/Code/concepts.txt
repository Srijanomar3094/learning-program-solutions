React Events
React events are just like DOM events but follow camelCase naming (onClick not onclick).

You pass a function reference instead of a string of code.

Event Handlers
Functions that get triggered in response to an event (click, change, submit).

Can be class methods or arrow functions in functional components.

Synthetic Event
Reactâ€™s cross-browser wrapper around native events.

Same interface as browser events, but works the same way across all browsers.

Naming Convention
Events: camelCase (onChange, onClick)

Handler functions: Often handleSomething or onSomething naming style.
